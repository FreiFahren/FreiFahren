# FreiFahren

## Overview

Freifahren is an innovative project designed to map the presence of ticket inspectors across the Berlin public transport network. By offering a live map that tracks inspectors in real-time, the initiative seeks to inform and empower users to navigate the city with added confidence. The project leverages community-driven data from the [Freifahren Telegram group](https://t.me/freifahren_BE), where users report sightings of ticket inspectors.

## How it works 

FreiFahren operates by leveraging real-time, community-driven data to track the presence of ticket inspectors across the Berlin public transport network. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Data Collection:**  Our primary data source is the [FreiFahren Telegram group](https://t.me/freifahren_BE) and our own form. Here, community members report sightings of ticket inspectors. Each report includes the station and time of the sighting.

2. **Data Processing:** Once a report is submitted, our backend system processes the data. It verifies the report, extracts the necessary information, and updates our database.

3. **Real-Time Updates:** The processed data is then pushed to our live map in real-time. This ensures that users always have the most up-to-date information about the presence of ticket inspectors.

4. **User Interface:** Users can access the live map through our web application. The map displays the current locations of ticket inspectors, allowing users to plan their journeys accordingly.

5. **Community Engagement:** Users are encouraged to contribute to the community by reporting their own sightings of ticket inspectors. This helps keep the map accurate and up-to-date.

By harnessing the power of community reporting and real-time data processing, FreiFahren provides a valuable tool for navigating the Berlin public transport network with confidence.
