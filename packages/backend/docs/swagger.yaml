        This endpoint retrieves ticket inspector reports from the database within a specified time range.
        It supports filtering by start and end timestamps,
        and checks if the data has been modified since the last request using the "If-Modified-Since" header.

        Accepts a JSON payload with details about a ticket inspector's current location.
        This endpoint validates the provided data, processes necessary computations for linking stations and lines,
        inserts the data into the database, and triggers an update to the risk model used in operational analysis.
        If the 'timestamp' field is not provided in the request, the current UTC time truncated to the nearest minute is used automatically.
